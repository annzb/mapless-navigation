# 3D Occupancy Prediction from Dense Radar Images

This project focuses on predicting occupied space from dense 3D radar data. Millimeter-wave radar provides reliable sensing under challenging conditions, such as low visibility or adverse weather, where cameras and lidars are limited. While radar has been widely used for navigation and SLAM, the resolution and accuracy of currrent approaches remain significantly lower than those of lidar.

The objective of this project is to train a neural network to convert dense radar images into high-resolution occupancy predictions. This README outlines the dataset, model architecture, and loss functions used.
